# Transportation System with Design Patterns
## Overview
This project aims to solve the transportation problem by introducing a dynamic system that adapts to passenger demand and quantity. The shuttle service will operate in response to passengers' preferences, strategically navigating through various locations to efficiently complete their route. By establishing a seamless communication channel, passengers can effortlessly report their locations, facilitating the shuttle's ability to optimize its route based on the collective passenger positions. This intelligent system not only enhances the overall efficiency of campus transportation but also provides a personalized experience for passengers, ensuring their satisfaction. Furthermore, the proactive notification mechanism upon departure serves as a valuable feature, keeping passengers well-informed about the shuttle's progress and enhancing the overall user experience.

## Running
This project is a transportation management system simulation. When you run the code, the first thing you see is a map. You can create passengers by clicking on the points you want on this map. You can delete the passenger by right-clicking on the passengers. When the number of passengers on the map reaches the maximum number of passengers that can board the shuttle, no more passengers can be added. By looking at the locations of its Passengers, the Shuttle calculates the most cost-effective route and begins its journey. After picking up all the passengers waiting at the stop, it completes its route at the last station and unloads the passengers.
